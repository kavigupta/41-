The .jar file shown is the 41++ Editor, which can be used to edit and execute
41++ programs. An example program is given, which demonstrates arithmetic,
control flow, and function definition; important 41++ constructs.


About 41++:

41++ is an interpreted, statically typed, legible programming language. It is
designed as a first language for people who do not know programming, and thus
is designed to look as much as English as possible. This project began as my
senior project, but I chose to continue working on it into the summer.


Further work:

The 41++ manual is incomplete, and the specification, which was deviated from
during the course of the project, is out of date.

Additionally, there are some bugs that need to be fixed in both the IDE and the
interpreter (especially the error reporting system). This project is by no means
complete.
